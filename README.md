Facial_Expression_Recognition_System

Facial expression recognition is a technology which uses biometric markers to detect emotions in human faces.

The Six universal expressions:- Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Fear, and Disgust.

Understanding_Facial_Expression Because facial expressions convey nonverbal communication cues that play an important role in interpersonal relations.

Facial expression recognition can save the day by allowing companies to conduct market research and measure moment-by-moment facial expressions automatically, making it easy to aggregate the results.

GAMING_INDUSTRY

Facial expression recognition can also be used in the video game testing phase. A focused group of users are asked to play a game for a given amount of time and their behavior and emotions are monitored. By using facial expression recognition, game developers can gain insights and draw conclusions about the emotions experienced during game play and incorporate that feedback in the making of the final product.

BEHAVIOURAL_TESTING

Suppose you have built some product and want to understand the genuine feedback of your customer on it, then you can incorporate facial expression recognition on your product which keeps tracking customerâ€™s emotions. It makes it easy to capture a few expressions like sadness , happiness or surprise while they walk through your product
